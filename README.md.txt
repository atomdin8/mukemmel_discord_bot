Hello! This is my discord bot.

Features of my bot:
1) As soon as my bot connects, it will notify you that it is connected. It sends a message to the channel (Channel ID) to show what commands it has.

2) You can see a stats.txt file that keeps the information sent in the channel (at this time, so many messages) and the commands that provide writing to this file.

3) Changes the name of users using unwanted names.

4) Listens to the message channel, if there are words containing sadness or insulting words, it responds to the channel or removes the sent message from there.

5) With the $code command, you can see every command the bot has.

6) With the $users command, you can print the number of people on the server .

7) With the $clean <num> command, you can delete the unwanted messages in the channel as many times as <num>.

8) With the $quote command, our bot reads the text document from the relevant website, and prints the quotation and the author of any line except for the headings and spaces.

9) The $offline <num> command, makes the bot completely offline if no digits are written. If the number is written, it stays offline until the minute it is written and then comes back online. It cannot react to any command during its offline time.

10) With the $guess <num> command, it selects a number in the specified number range and asks the user to find it, then prints the number of tries.

11) The $roll <num> command, selects a number in the number range specified in the area of command and prints it.
